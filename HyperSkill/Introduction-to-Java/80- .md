### Multidimensional Arrays 80

A multidimensional array is an array of arrays - think of an array as an element of another array

**one-dimensional array** - represented as a single sequence of elements

**two-dimensional array** - represented as a matrix or a table.

- We say “the arrays are nested in the `twoDimArray`” and the `twoDimArray` is called the main array.
- nested arrays do not necessarily have to be of the same size - in `twoDimArray`each new embedded array has different lengths

```java
int[][] twoDimArray = {
        {0, 0},       // the length is 2
        {1, 2, 3, 4}, // the length is 4
        {3, 3, 3}     // the length is 3
};
```

**Access the elements** - we have to access *two* indices: first the index of the element of the main array, and then the index of the nested array.

Example: to access the element in the first row and the first column, we need to select the nested array by its index in the main array, then within the nested array select the element index. 

```java
int[][] twoArray = {
        {3, 4, 5},  // [0]        
				{6, 7, 8},  // [1]};
```

```java
System.out.println(twoArray[0][0]); // 3
System.out.println(twoArray[0][1]); // 4
System.out.println(twoArray[0][2]); // 5
System.out.println(twoArray[1][0]); // 6
System.out.println(twoArray[1][1]); // 7
System.out.println(twoArray[1][2]); // 8
```

**Working with 2D arrays** - one of the most popular ways to create a multidimensional array is using a `for` loop.

```java
//Create a 2D array with 2 rows and 10 columns, and fill it with ones.
int[][] twoDimArray = new int[2][10];

for (int i = 0; i < twoDimArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < twoDimArray[i].length; j++) {
        twoDimArray[i][j] = 1;
    }
}
```

```java
//print every element we need two for loops
for (int i = 0; i < twoDimArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < twoDimArray[i].length; j++) {
        twoDimArray[i][j]++;
        System.out.print(twoDimArray[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

```java
//print all nested arrays
for (int i = 0; i < twoDimArray.length; i++) {
     System.out.println(Arrays.toString(twoDimArray[i]));
}
```

```java
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

```java
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Multidimensional arrays (>2)**

a **three-dimensional** array - represented as a cube or a box

```java
//2 = number of rows, 3 = number of columns and 4 = number of elements in a nested array.
int[][][] threeDimArray = new int[2][3][4];

int element = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < threeDimArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < threeDimArray[i].length; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < threeDimArray[i][j].length; k++) {
            threeDimArray[i][j][k] = element;
        }
        element++;
    }
}
```

```java
//print the nested arrays
for (int i = 0; i < threeDimArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < threeDimArray[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(Arrays.toString(
												threeDimArray[i][j]) + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

```java
[0, 0, 0, 0] [1, 1, 1, 1] [2, 2, 2, 2]
[3, 3, 3, 3] [4, 4, 4, 4] [5, 5, 5, 5]
```

```java
System.out.println(threeDimArray[0][0][0]); // 0
System.out.println(threeDimArray[0][1][0]); // 1
System.out.println(threeDimArray[1][0][1]); // 3
System.out.println(threeDimArray[1][2][3]); // 5 – the last element of the last array
```

### Formatted Output81

Recall - to print output to console we have `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()`

**`System.out.printf(first part, second part)`** 

- first part = String you want to format including rules to format it via **format specifiers** like ****`%d`, `%s`, etc.
- second part = argument list that Java can use to format the String according to the format specifiers

Example: `System.out.printf("My Name is %s. I was born in %d", "Mike", 1998);` 

**format-specifiers**

- %d - display integer `System.out.printf("Display a Number %d", 15000);` = Display a Number 15000;  `System.out.printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d", 15, 40, 55);`
- %f - display floating-point value: `System.out.printf("Display a Number %f", 15.23);` = Display a Number 15.230000
    
    .2f - set the precision: here the number of digits after the decimal place is two - `System.out.printf("Display a Number %.2f", 15.23);` = Display a Number 15.23
    
- %c - display a character: `char abbr = 'H';`
- %s - display a String: `String element = "Hydrogen";`
    
    `System.out.printf("%c stands for %s", abbr, element);` = H stands for Hydrogen
    

**`String.format()`** method - returns a String instead of printing it

`int age = 22;` `String str = String.format("My age is %d", age);` - Java will create a String called `str` by concatenating `My age is` with the value of the `age` variable.

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
    int age = 22;
    char initial = 'M';
    String surname = "Anderson";
    double height = 1.72;

    String details = String.format(
            "My name is %c. %s.%nMy age is %d.%nMy height is %.2f.",
            initial, surname, age, height);
    System.out.println(details);
}
```

Java will replace `%c, %s, %d, %f` with `initial`, `surname`, `age`, and `height` respectively. 

`%n` is the **newline** character that breaks the line every time it is used.

Output

```
My name is M. Anderson.
My age is 22.
My height is 1.72.
```

Can also use `.formatted(Object... args)` like - `String details = "My name is %c. %s.%nMy age is %d.%nMy height is %.2f.".formatted(initial, surname, age, height);`

`.formatted()` is an instance method. `String.format()` is a static method.

### Writing Files82

**The `FileWriter` class** - `java.io.FileWriter` has a set of constructors to write characters and strings to a specified file:

- `FileWriter(String fileName)`;
- `FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append)`;
- `FileWriter(File file)`;
- `FileWriter(File file, boolean append)`;

The parameter `append` indicates whether to append (`true`) or overwrite (`false`) an existing file.

All these constructors can throw an `IOException` - if the named file exists but is a directory; if a file does not exist and cannot be created; if a file exists but cannot be opened.

If the specified file does not exist, it will be created after executing this code. 

If the file already exists, this code overwrites the data.

To append new data, specify the second argument as true `FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file, true);`

`writer.write("Hello, World\n");` - appends a new line to the file

```java
File file = new File("/home/username/path/to/your/file.txt");
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file); // overwrites the file
writer.write("Hello");
writer.write("Java");

writer.close();
```

```java
File file = new File("/home/username/path/to/your/file.txt");

try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file)) {
    writer.write("Hello, World");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.printf("An exception occurred %s", e.getMessage());
}
```

Closing a `FileWriter` **-** close a `FileWriter` after use to avoid a resource leak by invoking the close method: `writer.close();`

Since Java 7, a convenient way to close an object of `FileWriter` is to use the try-with-resources statement. It will close the writer automatically.

**The `PrintWriter` class** - `java.io.PrintWriter` - allows you to write formatted data to a file. It can output strings, primitive types and an array of characters. 

- `PrintWriter(String fileName)`;
- `PrintWriter(File file)`.
- `.PrintWriter(Writer writer)` - pass `FileWriter` as a class that extends the `Writer` abstract class

The class provides several overloaded methods: `print`, `println` and `printf`.

Create an instance of `File` and a `PrintWriter` with the **try-with-resources** statement to close it correctly. 

Output

```java
HelloJava
123
You have 400 gold coins
```

```java
File file = new File("/home/art/Documents/file.txt");
try (PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(file)) {
    printWriter.print("Hello"); // prints a string    
		printWriter.println("Java"); // prints a string and then terminates the line    
		printWriter.println(123); // prints a number    
		printWriter.printf("You have %d %s", 400, "gold coins"); // prints a formatted string
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.printf("An exception occurred %s", e.getMessage());
}
```

### Processing Strings83

A string is a sequence of characters with a single data type, and so is an array - a string looks like an array of characters. You can iterate over both strings and arrays.

**Strings and arrays** - convert between them using `valueOf()` and `toCharArray()`.

```java
char[] chars = { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' };

String stringFromChars = String.valueOf(chars); // "ABCDEF"
char[] charsFromString = stringFromChars.toCharArray(); // { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' }
String theSameString = new String(charsFromString); // "ABCDEF"
```

**Splitting the string** - call the `split` method, which divides the string into substrings by a **separator**.

```java
String sentence = "a long text";
String[] words = sentence.split(" "); // {"a", "long", "text"}
```

```java
String text = "Hello";
String[] parts = text.split(""); // {"H", "e", "l", "l", "o"}
```

**Iterating over a string** - use a loop (while, do-while, for-loop).

```java
String scientistName = "Isaac Newton";
for (int i = 0; i < scientistName.length(); i++) {
    System.out.print(scientistName.charAt(i) + " ");
}
```

```java
String number = "+1-213-345-6789";
String[] parts = number.split("-"); // {"+1", "213", "345", "6789"}
```

```java
String text = "I'm gonna be a programmer";
String[] parts = text.split(" gonna be "); // {"I'm", "a programmer"}
```

In strings & arrays, indexing begins from `0`. Here, the for-loop iterates over the string `"Isaac Newton"` . With each iteration, the `charAt` method returns the current character at the `i` index, and that character is then printed to the console, followed by a blank space. Output

```java
I s a a c   N e w t o n
```

### Array Exceptions84

**`NullPointerException`** - an array is a reference type, which means its variable can be `null` , and that may lead to NPE.

```java
int[] numbers = null;
int size = numbers.length; // It throws an NPE
int size = numbers == null ? 0 : numbers.length; //check for null values
```

**`NegativeArraySizeException`** - creating an array with a negative size will compile successfully, but will throw a `NegativeArraySizeException` while executing.

```java
int negSize = -1;
int[] numbers = new int[negSize]; // an exception here
```

**`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`** - caused by attempting to access a non-existent element of the array.

```java
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3 }; // an array of ints
int n1 = array[2]; // n1 is 3
int n2 = array[3]; // Exception
array[-1]; // Exception
```

the last line produces an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` since the last index of the array in question is 2.

To avoid the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, we may check if the given index belongs to the interval **[0, length – 1].**

- the index is -1, the program outputs "The index is out of bounds.";
- the index is 5, the program outputs "The index is out of bounds.".

```java
public class NoIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] hardCodedArray = { 3, 2, 4, 5, 1 };
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int index = scanner.nextInt();

        if (index < 0 || index > hardCodedArray.length - 1) {
            System.out.println("The index is out of bounds.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(hardCodedArray[index]);
        }
    }
}
```

Since a string can be considered as a sequence of characters, a similar exception may occur when accessing a non-existing element of a string. It is called `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

### What are streams 87

Sometimes your program should process data located outside it or save results to an external destination. Java provides an abstraction called **stream** that unifies work with disks, files, network locations and other resources.

**Input and output streams** - IO streams can be categorized into two groups:

- input streams - read data from a source;
- output streams - write data to a specified destination.

we already know two specific examples of IO streams: `System.in` and `System.out` - used to read/write data from/to the console.

**Byte and char streams**

- **byte streams** that are used to read and write data in bytes;
- **char streams** that are used to read and write data in characters according to the 16-bit Unicode format.

Char streams make processing text data much easier for programmers.

**Buffered streams** - 

Some streams use a temporary memory location. At first, such streams read/write data to a temporary location, and then data is moved to a source/destination from it. This temporary location is typically a byte or character array called **a buffer**, and the whole process is called **buffering**. An intermediate memory location is introduced because interacting with some sources/destinations takes a substantial time interval. So buffering is a kind of optimization that minimizes the number of interactions with them.

Output streams: when writing data to the stream, it is first accumulated in a buffer. Once the buffer is full, the whole stored data is written to the destination.

Input streams: when a stream reads data for the first time, it reads as much as a buffer can hold. Even if only a few bytes/characters were requested, the buffered input stream will read bytes until the buffer is full. The next reading first checks if there is any unread data in the buffer. In case the buffer contains some unread data, the stream takes it from the buffer and does not have to interact with the source. Otherwise, it requests data from the source like the first time.

---

### Input streams 88

Every program consumes data to communicate with the outer world, like user input from the console or a configuration file. Java has a common mechanism for consuming data called input streams.

**sources** - any data that can be consumed and processed by a program, e.g. standard input, files, network connections, in-memory buffers, objects.

**Character Streams** - classes for reading text data (char or String), like `FileReader`, `CharArrayReader`, `StringReader`, etc. (the class name indicates what source type is used as input) - they all extend the `java.io.Reader` class. 

- `int read()` reads a single character. If the end of the stream is reached, the method returns the value `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the numerical representation of the character according to the current encoding;
- `int read(char[] cbuf)` reads a sequence of characters into the passed array up to its capacity and returns the number of characters that were actually read. It can also return `-1`  in case no data was read;
- `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)` reads characters into a portion of an array.
- `void close()` that should be invoked after a stream was used.

These methods also block the program from running until some input is available or the end of the stream is reached.

Example: `FileReader` has a set of constructors. It can read text data from the file indicated either by a path `String` or as a `File` object. 

- `new FileReader(String fileName)`
- `new FileReader(String fileName, Charset charset)`
- `new FileReader(File file)`
- `new FileReader(File file, Charset charset)`

A `Charset` is a class that declares the encoding from sequences of bytes to characters. By default, java uses the UTF-16 encoding. However, sometimes the file may have another encoding and you'll have to use a different charset to read the content of the file properly.

```java
//we have file.txt with content: input stream
Reader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");

char first = (char) reader.read(); // i
char second = (char) reader.read(); // n
char[] others = new char[12];
int number = reader.read(others); // 10
```

After running the code, `others` will contain `['p', 'u', 't', ' ', 's', 't', 'r', 'e', 'a', 'm', '\u0000', '\u0000']`.

Since we read the first two letters into other variables, the first 10 characters of `others` are filled starting from the third letter. When the stream reached the end of the file it stopped reading, so the last two characters are not updated.

When you create an empty array it is filled with default values, which are `'\u0000'` for a char array. `'\u0000'` is interpreted as an empty symbol and not displayed at all, although technically it is present.

Another common way of reading a text data stream is to read it char by char until the stream is closed:

When `-1` is returned, it means the end of stream was reached, so that is there's nothing left to read.

```java
FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");

int charAsNumber = reader.read();
while(charAsNumber != -1) {
    char character = (char) charAsNumber;
    System.out.print(character);
    charAsNumber = reader.read();
}
reader.close();
```

**Byte Streams** - classes for reading data (audio, video, zip, etc) as bytes, all extend the `java.io.InputStream`class.

Recall. to read some text data from the standard input: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` . `System.in` is an example of a byte input stream. There are other specialized byte stream classes: `ByteArrayInputStream` is used for reading from `byte[]`, `FileInputStream` is dedicated for files, and `AudioInputStream` is a way of consuming audio input.

All byte stream classes have methods for reading similar to character input streams:

- `abstract int read()` reads a single byte;
- `int read(byte[] b)` reads a number of bytes and stores them in a byte array;
- `byte[] readAllBytes()` reads all bytes.
- `void close()` that should be invoked after a stream was used.

The methods that read bytes into an array, returns an `int` value. It is the number of bytes read from the source. If `-1` value is returned it is a sign that no bytes were read.

Example: Suppose we have a file `file.txt` that contains the following text: `input stream`. Read it using the `FileInputStream` class:

- `new FileInputStream(String pathToFile)`
- `new FileInputStream(File file)`

Now `bytes`contains `['i', 'n', 'p', 'u', 't']`.

```java
FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
byte[] bytes = new byte[5];
int numberOfBytes = inputStream.read(bytes);
System.out.println(numberOfBytes); // 5
inputStream.close();
```

Pressing Enter doesn't close the input stream*.* It is still opened and waits for input. To actually close the input stream you need to produce an *end-of-file* event. In IDEA, you should press <**Ctrl>+D** (Windows and Linux) or **<command>+D** (MacOS).

### **Try with resources** 89

Input streams should be closed after they were used. How closing can be performed and why it is important?

**Why close?** When an ****input stream is created, the JVM notifies the OS about its intention to work with a file. If the JVM process has enough permissions and everything is fine, the OS returns a file descriptor - a special indicator used by a process to access the file. The problem is that the number of file descriptors is limited. This is why it is important to notify the OS that the job is done and the file descriptor that is held can be released for further reusing, by invoking `close` . Once called, the JVM releases all system resources associated with the stream.

**Pitfalls** - `close()` might not be called if an exception is thrown before it. To solve, we can use the try-catch-finally construction: `try { reader = new FileReader("file.txt"); ... // code which may throw an exception} finally { reader.close();}` . But, `close()` can potentially raise exceptions too. Suppose, there are two exceptions: the first raised inside the `try` **section, and the second thrown by the `finally` **section. It leads to the loss of the first exception. 

**Solution** - **try-with-resources** - 

```java
try (Reader reader1 = new FileReader("file1.txt");
     Reader reader2 = new FileReader("file2.txt")) {
    // some code
}
```

```java
try (Reader reader = new FileReader("file.txt")) {
    // some code} catch(IOException e) {
    ...
} finally {
    ...
}
```

Round brackets contain statements that create an input stream instance. The `close` method is implicitly invoked for all objects declared in the first part. The construction guarantees closing all resources in a proper way. The second part contains code to deal with the object that was created in the first part.

You may initialize an input stream outside the construction and then declare it in round brackets

```java
Reader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");
try (reader) {
    // some code
}
```

**Closable resources** - Closing is crucial for other outside sources like web or database connections. 

Consider `java.util.Scanner`. We used `Scanner` for reading data from the standard input, but it can read data from a file as well. `Scanner` has a `close` method for releasing outside sources. 

```java
//reads two integers separated by a space from a file and print them
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("file.txt"))) {
    int first = scanner.nextInt();
    int second = scanner.nextInt();
    System.out.println("arguments: " + first + " " + second);
}
```
